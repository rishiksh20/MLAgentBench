Human: Given this python script:
    ```python 
    
    ```
    Edit the script by following the instruction:
    Implement the dynamic programming approach for longest increasing subsequence. Initialize a dp array with 1s, iterate through each element, and update dp[i] based on previous elements. Return the maximum value in dp.
    Provide the full code after the edit, making no other changes. Start the python code with "```python".
