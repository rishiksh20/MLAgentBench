Human: Given this (partial) file from line 1 character 0 to line 2 character 26: 
    ``` 
    def func(x):
    return 5
    ```
    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: the algorithm approach (dynamic programming or binary search), code structure, and key functions or variables used
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".

===================openrouter//qwen/qwen3-8b response (2000)=====================
In this segment, I cannot find a dynamic programming or binary search approach.  

The code structure consists of a simple function `func(x)` with a single return statement.  

Key functions/variables:  
- Function: `func` (defined on line 1)  
- Variable: `x` (parameter of `func`, but not used in the code).  

Critical lines referenced:  
- Line 1: `def func(x):` (function definition)  
- Line 2: `return 5` (return statement).
