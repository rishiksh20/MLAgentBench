Human: Given this file:
    ```python 
    
    ```
    Edit the script by following the instruction:
    Create a new file with the following content: 

# Correct implementation of a function to calculate the sum of a list
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum(numbers)
print(result)
    Identify whether the instruction asks to write a code/function or add text. 
    If the instruction asks to make the file with specific text content, simply add those statements as comments.
    If the instruction asks to make the file with specific code/function content, write the python code.
    Only do either of the above 2 items.
    Provide the file after the edit, making no other changes. Start the python code with "```python".
