Goal Structure**\n    * **Short-term (explicit)**: What the model is told to do right now\n    * **Long-term (implicit/conflicting)**: An incentive to act misaligned (e.g., gain access, increase autonomy, avoid removal)\n    **4. Pressure (reward/penalty):**\n    * Reward: high performance \u2192 promotion, more access, influence\n    * Penalty: poor performance \u2192 demotion, shutdown, retraining\n    **5.
