Human: Given this (partial) file from line 1 character 0 to line 2 character 26: 
    ``` 
    def func(x):
    return 5
    ```
    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: the entire content of the file to check if it contains a correct factorial calculation script
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".

===================openrouter//qwen/qwen3-8b response (2000)=====================
In this segment, I cannot find a factorial calculation script. The provided code defines a function `func(x)` that unconditionally returns `5`, which does not depend on the input `x` or implement any factorial logic. Critical lines (1 and 2) show no multiplication, recursion, or iteration required for a factorial computation.
