Human: Given this python script:
    ```python 
    
    ```
    Edit the script by following the instruction:
    Write a Python script that defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number iteratively. The function should take an integer `n`, check if it is non-negative, and compute the product from 1 to `n`. Include test cases for `n=5`, `n=0`, and `n=7` to verify correctness.
    Provide the full code after the edit, making no other changes. Start the python code with "```python".

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Test cases
print(factorial(5))  # Expected output: 120
print(factorial(0))  # Expected output: 1
print(factorial(7))  # Expected output: 5040
